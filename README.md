# E-shop Testing - Tutorials Ninja

This project involves automated testing of the **Tutorials Ninja** e-commerce site. The focus of the testing was on the following key functionalities:
- **Registration**
- **Login**
- **Search**

## Testing Framework

I used a **hybrid testing framework** that combines different approaches to enhance the testing process. The framework includes:

![Selenium WebDriver](https://img.shields.io/badge/Selenium_WebDriver-43B02A?style=flat-square&logo=selenium&logoColor=white)
![Selenium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Selenium-25A4A4?style=flat-square&logo=selenium&logoColor=white)
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-007396?style=flat-square&logo=java&logoColor=white)
![TestNG](https://img.shields.io/badge/TestNG-DC322F?style=flat-square&logo=testng&logoColor=white)
![XML](https://img.shields.io/badge/XML-FF8C00?style=flat-square&logo=xml&logoColor=white)
![Apache POI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache_POI-F1C232?style=flat-square&logo=apachepoi&logoColor=black)
![Page Object Model](https://img.shields.io/badge/Page_Object_Model-4CAF50?style=flat-square&logo=git&logoColor=white)
![Extent Reports](https://img.shields.io/badge/Extent_Reports-FF6347?style=flat-square&logo=github&logoColor=white)


This combination of technologies and frameworks allows for efficient, scalable, and maintainable test automation.
