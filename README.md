# E-shop Testing - Tutorials Ninja

This project involves automated testing of the **Tutorials Ninja** e-commerce site. The focus of the testing was on the following key functionalities:
- **Registration**
- **Login**
- **Search**

## Testing Framework

I used a **hybrid testing framework** that combines different approaches to enhance the testing process. The framework includes:

- **Selenium WebDriver** for automating browser interactions
- **Java** as the programming language
- **TestNG** for test execution and management
- **XML** for test configuration
- **Apache POI** for reading and writing data to Excel files
- **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern for better test maintenance and readability
- **Extent Reports** for generating detailed and interactive test reports

This combination of technologies and frameworks allows for efficient, scalable, and maintainable test automation.

## Key Features Tested

- **Registration**: Ensured that the registration process works as expected, including form validation and successful user creation.
- **Login**: Verified that the login functionality works with correct and incorrect credentials.
- **Search**: Tested the search functionality to confirm that products can be found using relevant keywords.
